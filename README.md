After minfying all files in /js all import statements need to be deleted in js.min.js and the reference to 'settings.' aswell.

Currently everything is in German. The file you would need to customize most is custom-settings.js in js/. It has a lot of explainations, but in German. 

I will add a better README in time and translate everything back to English.
